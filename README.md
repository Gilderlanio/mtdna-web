The mtDNA mutation-cancer network

We constructed a bipartite network of mutations and cancer based on two distinct datasets (references below). The mutation-cancer network is a graph G(V, E), where V comprises two distinct sets of nodes: mitochondrial mutations (u) and cancers (v).

For interactive and visualization analysis, our tool includes data from the following references:

The mtDNA mutation-cancer network is developed by the Laboratory of Human and Medical Genetics (LGHM) at the Institute of Biological Sciences from the Federal University of Pará, Belém, Pará, Brazil.
